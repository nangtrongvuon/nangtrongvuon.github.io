### Welcome to my blog.

This is a place where I can express myself. The theme is Vida by syaning (You can find it  [here!](http://github.com/syaning/vida)).

I started coding about a year ago. I jumped from language to language, learning on-and-off until a few months back (around, June 2015). I then made a **real** effort to learn programming. I now dabble in Python and Swift, struggling day to day in the quest to become a full fledged iOS dev.

Currently doing blog posts on how I understand programming. I kind of think of this blog as a self-reference book. I hope my posts may be of help to someone.
