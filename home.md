### Welcome to my blog.

This is a place where I can express myself. The theme is Vida by syaning (You can find it  [here!](http://github.com/syaning/vida)).

I started coding about a year ago. I jumped from language to language, learning on-and-off until a few months back (around, June 2015). I then made a **real** effort to learn programming, and now I know a little bit of HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, jQuery.

Thanks to a nice [**Mr. Cody Seibert**](https://github.com/codyseibert), I now am on the path to becoming a web developer. I hope to launch my first real project, **Project Susurrus**, a *distraction-free manga reader* in the coming year.

Just remember, **you never code alone!**
