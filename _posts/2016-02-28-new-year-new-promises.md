So it's nearly been a month since the new year, and I've been making a lot of progress in my coding journey.

For one, I can make something now. I now know the basics of programming, and I can apply it to create something useful.

And, I think I found my solace in **Swift**. I dabbled in **Web Programming** for a while and got lost in all the frameworks, so I took a step back and focused on what my goals were: *To make an iOS app*. And what better way to do it than **Swift?**

So, here we go. This blog is going to be about my take on concepts in **Swift**, and *programming in general*. Being kind of a code newbie, I know very well the struggles of understanding and grasping programming concepts, especially when resources are mainly in a second language (for me, it's English.) It's going to be my own reference site, and I hope it might be of help to someone as well.

I'll try to write here as often as I can. It's going to be the way I stay motivated, and the manner in which I keep myself occupied and focused on my journey.

See you later,
