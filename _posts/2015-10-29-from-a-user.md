Before I was coding, I was a user. In fact, **being a user** was what inspired me to learn coding.

I do not claim to be an expert in user experience (UX). But I'll simply say things that I know.

I am the straightforward user - the more tech-savvy kind. I know the basics of operating a computer and the bundled software, alongside installing things I need like drivers or hardware on my own. ( I guess all of this helped me become a better tech support, but more on that later. )

I can sympathize with devs. Bugs are unexpected and hard to fix. You can't expect a dev to find all the bugs in his software all on his own - that's why you need things like beta tests. But, there are some things that **irk** me greatly.

I guess this is kind of like a note to myself - **DO NOT** make a program that has one or more of the elements listed below:

+ **Overly long animations**. One example is iOS's default animations - they are overly long and unneccesary, to the point where they make doing everything takes far longer than it should. If I tap on Settings, I expect to see the Settings screen as soon as possible. It's only cool as a party trick, and nothing more.

+ **Unresponsive**. Phone screens are a thing now, why is your site still unoptimized as hell for my smartphones? If I'm a potential customer/client and I can't see your site on my phone, say goodbye to me.

+ **Unclear/No instructions**. Like, come on. I'm not some kind of oracle or tech master, I can't know how to use your thingy if you give me no instructions at all, or the instructions are vague as hell and are hidden in some desolate corner of your software. No, just, no. I like software that are clear and easy to use. ( However, if the user refuses to read any documentations, that's on them. )

+ **Intrusive**. I get that you have to make money somehow, but app makers are extremely guilty of this. If your app has extremely intrusive ads, like the one that **FORCES** you to pay to uninstall it, then that's definitely going on my blacklist. You're going to be on my blacklist. Forever, and I'll tell my friends about it.

I guess I got bored and just wrote what was on my mind. Until next time, I guess~
